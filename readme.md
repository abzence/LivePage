# LivePage

## Overview

LivePage is a developer tool which reloads website resources (such as CSS, LESS, HTML and JavaScript) as they change on the server, so you are always looking at the most up-to-date version of a web page. It can make developing websites a lot faster, by helping productivity.

Key features are:
 * LESS support
 * Entire domains can be made live
 * file:// protocol is now supported

It's recommended you use this extension in a development environment (Such as XAMPP).
